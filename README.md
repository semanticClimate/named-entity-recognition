Description: 

The Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline is a modular, domain-sensitive framework for extracting key entities from scientific literatures, technical documents, or any scholarly literature. It focuses on extracting countries, species, diseases, and genes, with high precision through the combination of domain-specific models and curated validation strategies.
The jupyter notebook presented here has been designed for both research and applied analysis. The important features are:
- Modular – separate logic for each entity type
- Scalable – capable of processing large corpora
- Extendable – easily customized for new entity types or domains

The output of the notebook is the list of entities (countries, species, disease, gene etc) validated from different open access databases.
